# ECE-385
(Still in progress, check back in January for my exciting final project demo!)    
A description of the projects for UIUC ECE 385: Digital Systems Laboratory FA2021    
Course website: https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece385  

The SLC3, SDC and NIOS II, and VGA Text Mode Controller (and soon my final project!) are my favorite projects and I encourage you to look at them. 
The static hazards and logic processor labs were completed on breadboards, all other projects were completed using SystemVerilog to program an FPGA.
- Static Hazards: Analyze static hazards of switches.
- Logic Processor: Created a logic processor that could perform eight possible operations on two registers with various storing options.
- 16-bit Adders: Implented previous logic processor lab into SystemVerilog.
- 8-bit Multiplier: Implemented a multiplier using the shift add method using SystemVerilog.
- SLC3: Created a modified SLC3 CPU that could perform various given tasks.
- NIOS II: Enabled the FPGA to communicate with the NIOS II processor, VGA monitor, and USB peripherals.
- VGA Text Mode Controller: Created a basic GPU which read from memory to display on a VGA monitor. 
- Final project: In Progress!  

All projects here were worked in collaboration with Michael Grawe.

#  Academic Integrity reminder
Taken from ARTICLE 1, PART 4 – ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY AND PROCEDURE section b:
Plagiarism. No student shall represent the words, work, or ideas of another as their own in any academic endeavor. A violation of this section includes but is not limited to:
Copying: Submitting the work of another as one’s own.
- Direct Quotation: Every direct quotation must be identified by quotation marks or by appropriate indentation and must be promptly cited. Proper citation style for many academic departments is outlined in such manuals as the MLA Handbook or K.L. Turabian’s A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations. These and similar publications are available in the university bookstore or library. The actual source from which cited information was obtained should be acknowledged.
- Paraphrase: Prompt acknowledgment is required when material from another source is paraphrased or summarized in whole or in part. This is true even if the student’s words differ substantially from those of the source. A citation acknowledging only a directly quoted statement does not suffice as an acknowledgment of any preceding or succeeding paraphrased material.
- Borrowed Facts or Information: Information obtained in one’s reading or research that is not common knowledge must be acknowledged. Examples of common knowledge might include the names of leaders of prominent nations, basic scientific laws, etc. Materials that contribute only to one’s general understanding of the subject may be acknowledged in a bibliography and need not be immediately cited. One citation is usually sufficient to acknowledge indebtedness when a number of connected sentences in the paper draw their special information from one source.
