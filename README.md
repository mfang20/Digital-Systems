# ECE-385
(Still in progress, check back in January for my exciting final project demo!)    
A description of the projects for UIUC ECE 385: Digital Systems Laboratory FA2021    
Course website: https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece385  

The SLC3, SDC and NIOS II, and VGA Text Mode Controller (and soon my final project!) are my favorite projects and I encourage you to look at them. 
The static hazards and logic processor labs were completed on breadboards, all other projects were completed using SystemVerilog to program an FPGA.
- Static Hazards: Analyze static hazards of switches.
- Logic Processor: Created a logic processor that could perform eight possible operations on two registers with various storing options.
- 16-bit Adders: Implented previous logic processor lab into SystemVerilog.
- 8-bit Multiplier: Implemented a multiplier using the shift add method using SystemVerilog.
- SLC3: Created a modified SLC3 CPU that could perform various given tasks.
- NIOS II: Enabled the FPGA to communicate with the NIOS II processor, VGA monitor, and USB peripherals.
- VGA Text Mode Controller: Created a basic GPU which read from memory to display on a VGA monitor. 
- Final project: In Progress!  

Topics Covered:
- Combinational logic circuits
- Storage elements
- Hazards and race conditions
- Circuit characteristics (fanout, delays, etc.)
- Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
- Combinational networks (adders, multiplexes, etc.) in SystemVerilog
- Sequential networks (counters, shift registers, etc.) in SystemVerilog
- Synchronous state machines
- Static timing analysis, clock domains, metastability, and synchronization
- Logic simulation and testbenches
- Microprocessors and system on chip
- Project using a microprocessor and system on chip concepts

All projects here were worked in collaboration with Michael Grawe.
